/*  Loops
• Loops are iterative statements
• Block of statements are repeatedly executed as long as condition is true
• Condition given in loop must become false after some finite iterations otherwise its a
infinite loop
• Values used in condition must update inside the body of finite loop
• Four types of loops
••
pre-tested loop while()
• post-tested loop do..while()
• counter controlled loop for()
• for each loop for Collections for()  */
